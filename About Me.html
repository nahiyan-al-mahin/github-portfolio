        <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>Hi there! My name is <b>Mahin Uddin.</b></p>

            <p>I’m a 3rd-year Software Engineering student at 
                <a href="https://seu.edu.bd/">Southeast University</a> 
                with a strong passion for game development. 
                I’m currently learning <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US">Unreal Engine</a>
                , and it’s been exciting to see how games are built from level zero. 
                Game development is where my heart is. I love the creativity and problem 
                solving that comes with it.</p>

            <p>I also enjoy working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>
                /<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++</a> 
                and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)">Python</a>, 
                and I’m slowly improving my skills by building small projects and learning from tutorials. 
                Outside of game dev, I have an interest in web and mobile app development, especially 
                front-end work. I genuinely love working with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a> 
                and exploring how websites and apps are designed.</p>
            
            <p>Right now, I’m focused on learning as much as I can and building a strong foundation. 
                My goal is to become a skilled developer who can create meaningful and fun experiences, 
                especially in the gaming world.</p>
